# myPortfolio
 This is my very final project with Team TreeHouse. My portfolio, which I intend to use professionally.

 My goal is to use everything I've learnt to build this portfolio. But I won't be limited to that. 
 I'll try to use some other resources to get to the looks and functions I want it to have.

 HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript will be the main things I'll use in this project. 
 I do, however, plan to use some BootStrap and React in this project too.
